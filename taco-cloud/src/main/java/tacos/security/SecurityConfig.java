				//against a user's password attribute.
				//it is nice because the actually password remains secret on the server side
				//.passwordEncoder(new BCryptPasswordEncoder()) // we add a further security to encrypted the attempted password.
				//.passwordAttribute("passcode")// by default the password given in the login form will be compared with
												//the value of the userPassword attribute in user's LDAP entry
												//if the password is kept in a different attribute, use .passwordAttribute() to specify the password attribute's name
